\begin{abstract}
    By using many different methods for regression with Artificial intelligence, monthly sales of different wares at different stores was predicted. The dataset used contained about 3 million listings of sales history, with 22 000 items and 59 different russian shops over a time frame of 33 months. Using non-linear methods a good prediction was made. With a test size of 0.3, a R-squared score of 0.59 and a accuracy of 0.68 was achieved.
